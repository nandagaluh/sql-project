# COFFEE SALES PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

## About
The Coffee Sales Performance Analysis project aims to analyze and evaluate the sales data for a portfolio of coffee products across various locations, customer segments, and time periods. By leveraging SQL and data analysis techniques, this project provides insight into the performance of coffee sales, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions to optimize sales strategies, marketing campaigns, and product offerings.

## Objective of The Project
The main objective of this analysis is to gain a deeper understanding of the sales trends, key drivers of revenue, and the overall performance of the coffee portfolio. Specifically.

## Methodology
> The analysis utilizes SQL queries to aggregate and manipulate the data, focusing on the following key metrics and dimensions:
> 1. **Total sales Analysis :** Calculating total sales for each product, location, and customer segment by multiplying quantity sold by price, then summing it up.
> 2. **Growth Trends:** Analyzing sales growth over time (monthly or yearly) to identify upward or downward trends.
> 3. **Customer Segmentation:** Grouping customers based on type (e.g., regular vs. loyal) and analyzing their impact on sales.
> 4. **Profitability:** Comparing revenue with product cost to determine the profit margin for each coffee product.

## Potential Use Case
> The findings from this analysis can be applied in several areas:
> 1. **Marketing Strategy:** Understanding the most profitable products and regions can guide targeted marketing campaigns.
> 2. **Product Portfolio Management:** Data on product performance can inform decisions on which products to promote or discontinue.
> 3. **Sales Forecasting:** Historical sales trends can be used to project future sales and adjust inventory levels accordingly.
> 4. **Customer Engagement:** By identifying customer segments, businesses can tailor promotions and loyalty programs to increase customer retention.

## Dashboard
Using Power BI, I’ve created a sales performance dashboard that tracks sales on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis, which helps us identify trends and understand how the business is performing across different timeframes. 
This deep insights could be useful for coffee shop owners and managers to track sales trends, identify growth opportunities, and optimize operations.

I implement the calendar hit map that dynamically adjust based on the selected month from a slicer. from each day on the calendar will be color-coded to represent sales volume with lighter shades indicating higher sales. 
This powerful visualization tool can helps businesses track and analyze data over specific time periods, such as days, weeks, or months. In the context of a coffee sales performance dashboard for June 2023, the Calendar Dashboard can be used to track daily, weekly, or monthly sales, identify trends, and understand the performance of the coffee shop or business across various timeframes. 
From total sales by weekend/weekday, we can see the insights into wether sales pattern differ significantly betweend weekdays and weekends. A bar char sales by strore location visualize sales data by different strore location and month on month sales increase for each store location to identify trends.

For this project I built a chart to identify and display the top 10 products base on the sales volume. A bar chart that shows the total sales for each product category over a specific time period, such as a week, month, or year. The x-axis represents total sales, and the y-axis represents product categories (Coffee, Backery, Tea, chocolate, etc).
This bar chart help me quickly understand which categories are performing the best. For June month, Coffee sales category has contributed the maximum the sales for the particular product category with increase +7.3%, second is tea with increased +3,8%, and the third is bakery +3.7%. I can consider introducing more coffee varieties or promotions to further boost that category.
While Package chocolate and flavour are performing decently, they only contribute to $2k. This might suggest that customers are not buying chocolate and flavour as often or are less aware of the offering. From product type bar chart we can see top ten total sales by product type, the maximum sales is barista espresso, second is brewed chai tea, third is gourment brewed coffee. To boost weak product sales, I could create more visibility for example  flavour by placing them closer to the checkout or offering bundled deals (e.g., discounted flavour with a coffee/tea). I could also introduce seasonal flavour or special offers to increase interest.

## Strategic Decisions
> From analyzing the coffee sales performance above, We can take several strategic action :
> **1.  Focuse on Maximum sales category :**  As it’s the top performer, We will ensure that coffee is always stocked, and promotions target coffee products. We could also expand the coffee menu, adding seasonal or premium coffee offerings.
> **2.  Optimizing Inventory and Staff:** By tracking sales trends, I can anticipate demand more effectively. For example, knowing that weekends tend to see higher sales, I can increase inventory levels of popular items like pastries and coffee beans.
> **3.  Planning for the Next Month:** Understanding the impact of promotions and launches can help us plan for future marketing activities or product introductions. If the new iced coffee line performed well in June, it might be a good idea to plan for more seasonal offerings.
