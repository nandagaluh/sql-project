# COFFEE SALES PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

## About
The Coffee Sales Performance Analysis project aims to analyze and evaluate the sales data for a portfolio of coffee products across various locations, customer segments, and time periods. By leveraging SQL and data analysis techniques, this project provides insights into the performance of coffee sales, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions to optimize sales strategies, marketing campaigns, and product offerings.

## Objective of The Project
The main objective of this analysis is to gain a deeper understanding of the sales trends, key drivers of revenue, and the overall performance of the coffee portfolio. Specifically.

## Methodology
> The analysis utilizes SQL queries to aggregate and manipulate the data, focusing on the following key metrics and dimensions:
> 1. **Revenue Analysis :** Calculating total revenue for each product, region, and customer segment by multiplying quantity sold by price, then summing it up.
> 2. **Growth Trends:** Analyzing sales growth over time (monthly or yearly) to identify upward or downward trends.
> 3. **Customer Segmentation:** Grouping customers based on type (e.g., regular vs. loyal) and analyzing their impact on sales.
> 4. **Profitability:** Comparing revenue with product cost to determine the profit margin for each coffee product.

## Potential Use Case
> The findings from this analysis can be applied in several areas:
> 1. **Marketing Strategy:** Understanding the most profitable products and regions can guide targeted marketing campaigns.
> 2. **Product Portfolio Management:** Data on product performance can inform decisions on which products to promote or discontinue.
> 3.  **Sales Forecasting:** Historical sales trends can be used to project future sales and adjust inventory levels accordingly.
> 4.  **Customer Engagement:** By identifying customer segments, businesses can tailor promotions and loyalty programs to increase customer retention.
